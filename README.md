##canvasteardown
Refactoring of my canvas library.

###Demo
There is a local demo you can see by addin the `app` directory to your localhost. Any way you want to do this should work fine. Alternatively, you can just go ahead and use the grunt tools installed to launch it on a localserver.

###Using grunt (optional)
* You must have Nodejs on your machine. If you don't, here's more info: [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/)
* Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```
* Then run the local server:
```
$ grunt serve
```
* The front-end demo will be on your localhost at port 5000, aka `http://localhost:5000`
